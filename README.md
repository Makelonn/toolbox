## Memories sorter

ðŸ”© How does that work ?

This script will sort all picture in repertory `path_to_picture` depending on the name of the picture. Names should be of the format : `IMG_YEARMONTHDAY_HOURMINSEC`; for example : `IMG_20200521_160512` is a picture taken on 21/05/2020. 

Folder structure :

    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ path_to_picture                    
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2020
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ jan
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feb
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2021  
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 20xx                
    â””â”€â”€ ...
