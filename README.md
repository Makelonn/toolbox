## Memories sorter

ðŸ”© How does that work ?

Folder structure :

    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ path_to_picture                    
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2020
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ jan
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feb
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2021  
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 20xx
